## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 2, part 1

    Lab 2, part 1, was one of my favorite labs because it helped me understand how to use strings for user input and output in a practical way. I enjoyed learning about how the program asked the user to enter a singular noun, a plural noun, and a present-tense verb, then used those inputs to generate a fun Mad Lib about computers. I also learned how line wrapping improves the readability of long output lines and keeps the code organized. Working through this lab helped me better understand how user input changes the behavior and final output of a program, which made it clearer and understandable.

* Lab 7, part 1

    Lab 7, part 1, was enjoyable because it taught me how to write a program that determines whether street parking is allowed based on posted signs. I learned how different streets have different rules depending on the day of the week, the hour, and even the minute. As I worked on completing this lab, I used strings, std::stoi, command-line arguments, and multiple if statements to validate the street name, day, hour, and minute. I was proud that my program passed all the unit tests by correctly applying every parking rule and printing the expected results.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9 stood out as one of the most challenging labs, but it quickly became one of my favorites because of how much I learned. In part 1, I used vectors, strings, and file input to read a dictionary and a document so the program could separate correctly spelled words from misspelled ones. I also learned how to read each word using ifstream and push the words into a vector for processing. In part 2, I wrote a program that used file I/O to hide a secret number from the player and compare each guess to the stored value. After completing it, I really enjoyed building this guessing game because it required careful use of conditions, user input, and file reading, especially when the program worked exactly as intended.
