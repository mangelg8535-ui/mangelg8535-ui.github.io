## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

My GitHub page is https://github.com/mangelg8535-ui.

* Lab 2, part 1

    Lab 2, part 1, was one of my favorite labs because it helped me understand how strings for both the user input and output work in C++. I liked how the program asked the user to enter a singular noun, a plural noun, and a present-tense verb, with the user inputting those nouns to generate a fun Mad Lib about computers for the user output. This lab helped me understand how line wrapping improves the readability of long user output lines and keeps the code of the program organized. It felt rewarding to go through this lab to understand how the user inputs and user outputs change a program's behavior and final user output, making it clearer and easier to understand.

* Lab 7, part 1

    Lab 7, part 1, was enjoyable because it taught me how to write a program that determines whether street parking is allowed based on posted signs. I learned how different streets have different rules depending on the day of the week, the hour, and even the minute. As I worked on completing this lab, I used strings, std::stoi, command-line arguments, and multiple if statements to validate the street name, day, hour, and minute. I was proud that my program passed all the unit tests by correctly applying every parking rule and printing the expected results for those planning to park or not to park.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9 stood out as one of the most challenging labs, but it quickly became one of my favorites because of how it was related to C++ and how it helped me understand object-oriented project programming better. In part 1, I used vectors, strings, and file input to read a dictionary and a document so the program could separate correctly spelled words from misspelled ones. I learned how to read each word using ifstream and push the words into a vector for processing. In part 2, I wrote a program that used file I/O to hide a secret number from the player and compare each guess to the stored value. After completing it, I really enjoyed building this guessing game because it required careful use of conditions, user input, and file reading, especially when the program worked exactly as intended.
